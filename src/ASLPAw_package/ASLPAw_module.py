def ASLPAw(data_graph: 'graph', Repeat_T: int = 30, seed: int = None) -> DiGraph:
    '''
        Returns a graph of the edges of each node with its own community tag node.
        
        ASLPAw can be used for disjoint and overlapping community detection and works on weighted/unweighted and directed/undirected networks. ASLPAw is adaptive with virtually no configuration parameters.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        data_graph : graph
            An NetworkX graph.
        
        Repeat_T : integer
            ASLPAw is an iterative process, this parameter sets the number of iterations.
        
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
        
        Returns
        -------
        communities : DiGraph
            Each node uses a community discovery map with a weighted edge pointing to its own community tag node.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> from networkx.generators.community import relaxed_caveman_graph

        >>> ASLPAw(data_graph, seed=65535).adj
